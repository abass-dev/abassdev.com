            <p>Abass Ben Cheik, also known as Abass Dev, was born on February 2, 1995, in Niamey, Niger, and is a self-taught full-stack developer who is currently 27 years old</p>
            <p>
              He started to be interested in web development at the age of 14,
              in 2009 but did not even know where to start.

            He developed an interest in web development at the age of 14 in 2009 but did not know where to begin. In 2011, he met a friend on Skyrock (a social network) who requested his help in administering a Wix-created blog. This was when Abass Dev began to delve into web development. In 2012, he decided to create his own blog on Blogspot (a platform created by Google).

            At first, things went well, but after a few days, he discovered that he was limited by the available features. This led him to seek a different solution and motivated him to learn deep web development using real web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and others.
